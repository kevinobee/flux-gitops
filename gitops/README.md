# Argo CD Applications

The `gitops` folder contains Argo CD [Application manifest files](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications) for automating deployments.

The [../gitops.yaml](../gitops.yaml) manifest file is used to bootstrap Argo CD with applications defined in the `gitops` folder.
